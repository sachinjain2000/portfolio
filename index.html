								</div>
								<p>I like solving real problems, especially the kind where data science, business decisions, and human behavior collide.</p>
								<p>I recently completed my Master's in Artificial Intelligence and Business Analytics, where I focused on using machine learning and modern analytics to build smarter systems and make decisions that actually move the needle. My background is in Computer Science and Data Science, but my curiosity often pulls me toward Psychology and Neuroscience. I am especially interested in how people think, where their biases hide, and how we can design AI to work with that complexity instead of against it.</p>
								<p>I enjoy turning messy data into clear insights using tools like Python, SQL, and Tableau. I am most excited when those insights lead to better decisions, stronger products, or smarter strategies. Whether it is building predictive models, automating processes, or making sense of unstructured information, I care about creating solutions that actually help.</p>
								<p>I have worked in startups, academia, and corporate teams. What I have learned is simple. Clear thinking wins. Iteration compounds. And no model beats a well-posed question. I care about building things that work, making things better than they were, and doing it with people who care just as much.</p>
								<p>Outside of work, I enjoy meaningful conversations, learning from people, and exploring new places. Lately, I have been loving surfing through the AI wave, exploring every new tool, and adding them to my tech stack along the way. I like following my curiosity, whether it leads to a new project, a good book, or an unexpected idea.</p>
								<p>I am currently looking for full-time roles in Business Analytics, Data Science, or Business Intelligence where I can contribute, learn, and solve meaningful problems. If something here resonates or you are working on challenges worth exploring, I would love to connect.</p>

								<h5>LinkedIn Job Insights: Analytical Exploration for Career Trends</h5>
								LinkedIn Job Insights is a project where I analyzed salary trends and compensation data to provide insights into market value and career progression. I deployed a multi-dimensional data visualization framework using Python libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to present complex LinkedIn job data insights in an interactive and engaging manner.

								<p></p>

								<h5>Data-driven Customer Segmentation and Targeted Marketing</h5>
								In this project, I utilized Python and R with MySQL for data manipulation to segment customers and enhance marketing strategies. I developed interactive visualizations with PowerBI and utilized Apache Spark for scalable data processing, enhancing the communication of insights derived from machine learning models.

								<p></p>

								<h5>Portfolio Website | <i>HTML, CSS, Javascript</i></h5>
								This website is a second iteration and is made primarily using HTML, CSS, and Javascript to present my skills and qualifications along with my journey as a software engineer. I aimed to design a clean and visually appealing interface to effectively communicate my experiences. I utilized CSS for styling and animation to enhance the overall user experience.
