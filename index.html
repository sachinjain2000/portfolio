								<span class="image main"><img src="images/intro.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I love to dig into business problems and solve them with modern technology like Artificial Intelligence and Analytics. To get better at it, I’m currently pursuing my Master’s in Artificial Intelligence and Business Analytics, leveraging its knowledge resources, and exposing myself to new opportunities every day.</p>
   								 <p>I’ve pursued education in Computer Science and Data Science and have a keen interest in Psychology and Neuroscience, especially in understanding why people make the decisions they make, the things they do, and the subconscious cognitive biases driving these decisions. My diverse background fuels my curiosity and drives my innovative approach to problem-solving.</p>
  								  <p>I enjoy meaningful conversations, leading teams, traveling, and never say no to an adventure. Bringing my ideas to life energizes me. I value authenticity and enjoy challenging conventional ideas and perspectives.</p>
  								  <p>I’m currently seeking spring 2025 Internship/Co-op & Full-time opportunities where I can make an impact and add value. To know more about me or discuss a topic, feel free to reach out!</p>
